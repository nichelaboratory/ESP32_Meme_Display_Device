#ESP32 TFT/OLED Display Meme Display Device
 Display Foul Bachelor Frog memes on ESP32 with OLED/TFT display

Here's how to make a fun little Foul Bachelor Frog (FBF) meme display device using an ESP32 microcontroller and an OLED display. It's a great beginner project and will definitely impress your emo friends. Maybe it will even help you find a girlfriend. Or possibly not. It would be easily modded to show other memes from the era when the internet was actually fun. I also made some other advice animals including Socially Awkward Penguin and Courage Wolf.

The source code includes 60 FBF captions. I had to shorten some of them and I also excluded any that wouldn't fit on a single line of text. Hopefully I've included most of the classics, but you could easily add more.

The screen I'm using in the video is a Waveshare 1.5 inch square OLED. It has a 128x128 pixel display. If you buy similar ensure it supports the SPI protocol and the SSD1351 display driver.

What you can learn in this example: ESP32 display bitmaps on an OLED/TFT/LCD display using the Adafruit Gfx library, how to use an SSD1351 display with the ESP32, simple C++ classes, choosing random items from an array, centering text on a screen.

Incidentally, be aware you might get screen burn if you display the same meme on a display for an extended period of time.
